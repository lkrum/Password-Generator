- Once my random password was generated, I couldn't figure out how to combine it with the new user password array, so I looked up a reference for this part of the code[w3collective](https://w3collective.com/random-password-generator-javascript/):

- Negin helped me format my window confirmation statements, helped me choose the right comparison operator, and format my arrays and strings correctly
- Patrick Lake, one of the bootcamp tutors, helped me finalize the math random function and helped me add returns
- Michael Bell helped me come up with the isNaN javascript method for validating whether my password input was not a number, so that I could prompt users to choose a valid input [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_isnan.asp)
